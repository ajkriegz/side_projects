# Brawl Stars Draft Assistant

## Purpose

The purpose of this code is to assist in picking characters in the Power League and Club League modes of Supercell's mobile game, Brawl Stars. Since these modes are timed, there is pressure to quickly look at the map, decide on which characters to ban from play, and then decide on your team's characters and synergy, all while reacting to what the opposing team is doing. While there is a large element of skill to the game, many matches are decided in the draft. Resources used are made by ViableFries, who can be found on youtube, twitter, and reddit creating quality Brawl Stars content.
