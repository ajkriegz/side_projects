# side_projects
Stuff I'm working on outside of class.

Current projects include:

## Brawl Stars Draft Assistant

This app takes a Brawl Stars map name as an input and opens an image that shows optimal characters and map lanes. Out of date with the current patch.

## Monthly Rent Calculator

This app takes three inputs: monthly rent, energy bill, and internet bill. Then it calculates my share and my roommate's share of rent, adjusted for pet payments.
